# File Data Reader
Read and process '.dat' files.

Author: Leonardo Brum Dorneles.

Properties set in 'application.yml'.

Logs will be generated in './logs' folder when application starts.

Not need to stop app to put more '.dat' files in '/data/in' folder.

The worst sallesman can be calculated in two modes:

- Calc of brute total value of salesman's sales.
- Calc considering the salesman's rentability (totalSales - salary).

You can choose between modes in the 'worst-salesman-by-sallary' attribute of 'application.yml'.

The unit tests use a own '.dat' file to work, so dotn't worry using '/data' folder.
